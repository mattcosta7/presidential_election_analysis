          By allocating 100% of a state's electoral votes to the winning candidate, and even rewarding the winner with only a few additional votes compared to the popular vote outcome in the state, the electoral system vastly overvalues certain votes, and the results do not accurately represent the will of the people.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Addition to giving more weight to proper sentiments, when voters are split, these methods each help to add value to votes as they are cast, since each additional vote in any state could have a much larger impact. Voters in states that traditionally vote in a specific party manner, often express anguish and feelings that show lack of engagement and empowerment.  Likewise, third parties are also somewhat veered away from, because this comes across as "Throwing out my vote". By more directly affecting the results in each state, these sentiments are assuaged.

        <p>
          By utilzing any voting method that more directly relates electoral votes to popular ones, state's maintain their more equal footing when voting for president, votes are not over/under-valued as easily, voters have enhanced feelings of enfranchisment, results are not markedly different, in almost all cases, and the deviations from sentiments are minimized - the process more directly reflects the will of the people, on a national and state-by-state level.
